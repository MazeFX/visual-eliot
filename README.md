# Visual Eliot
 
A GUI for displaying Eliot log files based on eliot-tree and PyQt.


## Quick start guide

Currently this is a first attempt to start a real package. Development is done under the active_dev branch and contains
the development POC. 

## Note

This is a personal project so it is not being developed on a regular basis. It contains bugs and does not account for
many use cases or custom stuff.
